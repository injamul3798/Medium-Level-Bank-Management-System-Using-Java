During my free time, I enthusiastically delved into Java programming, creating a feature-rich banking application. The Individual section offers functionalities like checking balance, viewing transactions, transferring money between account types, managing payees, and making payments to non-listed recipients. The Bank Administration section provides features for creating new accounts, transferring funds, withdrawing money, printing all existing accounts, and exiting the system, showcasing a diverse skill set in Java development.
