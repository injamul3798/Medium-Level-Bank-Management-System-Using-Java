We have seen the user requirements. We found two types of users:
1.	Individual Consumer
2.	Bank Administration

In the Individual section, we got some features, which are,
i.	View their Balance
ii.	View their Transaction by date
iii.	Transfer money between their own different account types
iv.	Add new Payee
v.	View payee
vi.	Payment to someone who is not in the list
vii.	Exit


And for Bank Administration, we also got some features:
i.	Create New Account
ii.	Transfer money from an existing account to another existing account
iii.	Withdraw money from existing account
iv.	Print all existing accounts
v.	Exit
